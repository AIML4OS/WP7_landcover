# This script gets the predicted classes from the flair model stored in .tif files for the pixel closest to each of the sampled coordinates 
# and stores these as well as additional metadata (pixel row/col, pixel number, pixel midpoint coordinates, sampled coordinates, band-value = class)
# make sure to change the output file as well as the location of the model output files.
